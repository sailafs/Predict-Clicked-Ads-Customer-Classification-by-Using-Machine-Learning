## Background
A company in Indonesia wants to know the effectiveness of an advertisement they launched online. This is important for the company to understand how well the advertisement reaches its target audience, so they can attract customers to click on the ad.
By processing historical advertisement data and uncovering insights and patterns, it can assist companies in determining their marketing targets. The focus of this case is to create a machine learning classification model that serves to identify the right target customers.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted thorough statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer behavior and demographics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Performed data cleaning, handled missing values, removed outliers, and applied feature engineering.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented and compared various models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Utilized metrics such as Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC, and Cross-Validation for comprehensive model assessment.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyzed the most influential features affecting ad clicks.
- **Business Recommendations**: Provided actionable insights and strategies based on the analysis.

## Key Findings
1. User behavior (internet usage and time spent on site) strongly influences ad engagement.
2. Geographic location and economic factors play significant roles in predicting ad interactions.
3. Some product categories are more effective at driving ad clicks than others.
4. XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model, showing consistent high performance across all metrics.

## Business Recommendations
- Optimize strategies based on internet usage patterns and site engagement.
- Implement geotargeting with a focus on key cities like Jakarta Selatan.
- Develop income-based targeting strategies.
- Focus on high-performing categories like Banking and House.
- Consider temporal factors in ad scheduling and campaign planning.

## Simulation Results
A simulation based on the model showed a 2.59% increase in conversions, resulting in an additional profit of Rp650,000, demonstrating the potential financial benefits of the data-driven approach.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
